- two hypothesis testing 
  - parametric test: based on the fact that variables are measured on an interval scale
    - one sample:
      - t-test: focus on one variable;refers to how MEANS of two sets of data differ from one another when variance is not given; population
        variance is close to sample varaince(方差); follows t-distribution
        - assumption of t-test:
          - all data points are independent
          - sample size is small < 30 but >= 5
          - sample values need to be taken
        
      - z-test: focus on one variableused when sample size > 30 and refers to how MEANS of two sets of data differ from each other when variance is given;                       follows normal distribution
        - assumption of z-test:
          - data points are independent
          - sample size > 30
          - normal distribution with mean of zero and variable 1

  - non-parametric test: varaibles measured on the ordinal(按照顺序) scale
